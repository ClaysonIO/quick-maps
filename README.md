# Visit Tracker

This is a tool for having a shared map for visiting a large number of people. Our congregation has a lot of people who are on our records, but we don't know if they're still in the area or not. This tool allows us to have a map that we can all see and update, so we can see who is still in the area and who isn't. It uses a Google Sheet as a backend, so it's easy to update and share.


## Setup
This is a react SPA with no backend. It can be run in any environment, but requires the following environment variable to connect to a sheet in Google Drive: 

| Variable                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
